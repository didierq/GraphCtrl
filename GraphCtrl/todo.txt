		|    DONE    |
		--------------

11/03/2024:
-----------
* Adding Serie select (not individual data selection) to GraphSerie/ScatterSeries  by selection on Plot
* ## Refactoring ##:
	* ClearDataSelection --> ClearSelection
	* Modification of SelectData() and  SelectOneData() methods :
		DÃ©cision to use Graph or Screen coordinates must not be left to final user code
		- added const MCoordinateConverter& coordConv
		- RectGraph rect --> RectScreen rect


08/03/2024:
-----------
* ALL xxx.tpp : Fixed broken documentation links : now documentation appears correctly while reading code
* GraphCtrl.usc : fixed issue with drop values in GraphCtrl avalaible in layout designer (issue probably appeared in 2022 with TheIde modifications)
* GraphCtrl:
	* come code cleaning
	* Added zoom XY KeepRatio
	* corrected some zooming issues

02/03/2024:
-----------
* Legend management:
	* Added Serie selection by selecting serie in Legend
	* Added Serie Highlight (serie legend gets highlighed when serie is selected)
	  Two types of Style applied
		* Whole serie is selected
		* Some Data of serie is selected

* Corrected GD_TIMINGS management

01/06/2021:
-----------

* GraphSerieEditorInterface:
   * Added default filling of Functions<>  (no more needed to fill them in custom creator function)
   * Changed procedure used to create GraphSerieEditorInterface instances
     ==> You now have to use   GraphSerieEditorInterface::Create()
         This allows to "catch" types and have full type checking in code
   * Added RevertChange() : used by the [Cancel] button (All is managed automatically by doing a copy of the Style before modifying it)
   !! NOTE !!! : All MY_GrapSerie::StyleGS   structs now MUST have an 'operator=()' defined  (needed to copy styles)

* Series Style editor :
   * corrected serie selection when filtering & sorting
   * Corrected preview update
   * added upddate of preview in list table

* Added FitToData() capacities to SimpleJobSerie  example

* Corrected FitToVisibleData()  (had same behaviour as FitToData() since refactoring)

* Removed method:  CustomData::PaintDataPoint(BufferPainter& , int scale, const MCoordinateConverter& coordConv )
  Only version with 'int style' is kept

* Introduced class : MCoordinateConverter 
	* Changed  GraphSerie::SelectXxx() API (to use MCoordinateConverter)
	* Changed  GraphSerie::PaintXxx() API (to use MCoordinateConverter)
	* Changed  CustomData class methods API (to use MCoordinateConverter)

* Added GraphSerie selection related action Functions<>
			Event<> WhenPreSelectAction;
			Event<> WhenPostSelectAction;

20/05/2021:
-----------
* introducing  Data Selection on series
    * Complete API introduced
    * First dev done for SimpleGraphSerie
    * Added to GraphCtrl :
        - Point selection : with or without APPEND
        - Rect selection : NOAPPEND_INCLUDED, APPEND_INCLUDED, NOAPPEND_INTERSECT, APPEND_INTERSECT
        - Selection Clear on ESCAPE key
    * Added Cursor image change for selection : NOAPPEND_INCLUDED, APPEND_INCLUDED, NOAPPEND_INTERSECT, APPEND_INTERSECT

* enum : converted 'enum' to 'enum class' where needed
    * changed  AxisTextFormat / AXIS_TEXT_FORMAT_xxx   ==> AxisTextFormat::FORMAT_xxx


* GraphSerie
    * Moved show and legend from   StyleGS_base  to GraphSerie  (these two parameters have nothing to do with style)
    * Added GraphSerie::GetHashValue_base()   ==> this method needs to be called by GetHashValue() in GraphSerie child classes
                                                  ScatterSeries and SimpleJobSerie  modified

            ClearAllCustomSeries()    ==> ClearAllOwnedGraphSeries()
            OwnedGraphDataSources     ==> GraphSeriesGroup::OwnedGraphSeries
            
            customDataSourceProxyVector ==> graphSeriesProxyList
